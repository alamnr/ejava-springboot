# Abstract
This comprehensive course explores core application aspects for developing, configuring, securing, deploying, and testing a Java-based service using a layered set of modern frameworks and libraries that can be used to develop full services and microservices to be deployed within a container. The emphasis of this course is on the center of the application (e.g., Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Data, and Spring Security) and will lay the foundation for other aspects (e.g., API, SQL and NoSQL data tiers, distributed services) covered in related courses.

Students will learn thru lecture, examples, and hands-on experience in building multi-tier enterprise services using a configurable set of server-side technologies.

Students will learn to:

- **Implement flexibly configured components and integrate them into different applications using inversion of control, injection, and numerous configuration and auto-configuration techniques**

- **Implement unit and integration tests to demonstrate and verify the capabilities of their applications using JUnit**

- **Implement API access to service logic using using modern RESTful approaches that include JSON and XML**

- **Implement data access tiers to relational and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases using the Spring Data framework**

- **Implement security mechanisms to control access to deployed applications using the Spring Security framework**

- **Package, run, and test services within a Docker container**

Using modern development tools students will design and implement several significant programming projects using the above-mentioned technologies in an environment that they will manage.

The course is continually updated and currently based on Java 17, Maven 3, Spring 6.x, and Spring Boot 3.x.

## Student Background

- **Prerequisite: 605.481 Distributed Development on the World Wide Web or equivalent**

- **Strong Java programming skills are assumed**

- **Familiarity with Maven and IDEs is helpful**

- **Familiarity with Docker (as a user) can be helpful in setting up a local development environment quickly**

### Student Commitment

**Students should be prepared to spend between 6-10 hours a week outside of class. Time spent can be made efficient by proactively keeping up with class topics and actively collaborating with the instructor and other students in the course.**

## Required Software

Students are required to establish a local development environment.

1. Software you will need to load onto your local development environment:

- Git Client

- Java JDK 17

- Maven 3 (>= 3.6.3)

- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or Pro or Eclipse/STS)

The instructor will be using IntelliJ IDEA CE in class, but Eclipse/STS is also a good IDE option. It is best to use what you are already comfortable using.

JHU VPN (Open Pulse Secure) — workarounds are available

2. Software you will ideally load onto your local development environment:

- Docker

- Docker can be used to automate software installation and setup and implement deployment and integration testing techniques. Several pre-defined images, ready to launch, will be made available in class.

- curl or something similar

- Postman API Client or something similar

3. Software you will need to install if you do not have Docker

- MongoDB

4. High visibility software you will use that will get downloaded and automatically used through Maven.

- application framework (Spring Boot, Spring).

- SLF4J/Logback

- a relational database (H2 Database Engine) and JPA persistence provider (Hibernate)

- JUnit

- Testcontainers

## Grading

100 >= A >= 90 > B >= 80 > C >= 70 > F

## Assessment                          -             % of Semester Grade

Class/Newsgroup Participation          -           10% (9pm EST, Wed weekly cut-off)

Assignment 0: Application Build        -           5% (##)

Assignment 1: Application Config       -           20%

Assignment 2: Web API                 -            15%

Assignment 3: Security                -            15%

Assignment 4: Integration Testing and Containers - 10%

Assignment 5: Database                 -           25%

Do not host your course assignments in a public Internet repository.
Course assignments should not be posted in a public Internet repository. If using an Internet repository, only the instructor should have access.

Assignments will be done individually and most are graded 100 though 0, based on posted project grading criteria.

## Assignment 0 will be graded on a done (100)/not-done(0) basis and must be turned in on-time in order to qualify for a REDO. The intent of this requirement is to promote early activity with development and early exchange of questions/answers and artifacts between students and instructor.

Class/newsgroup participation will be based on instructor judgment whether the student has made a contribution to class to either the classroom or newsgroup on a consistent weekly basis. A newsgroup contribution may be a well-formed technical observation/lesson learned, a well formed question that leads to a well formed follow up from another student, or a well formed answer/follow-up to another student’s question. Well formed submissions are those that clearly summarize the topic in the subject, and clearly describe the objective, environment, and conditions in the body. The instructor will be the judge of whether a newsgroup contribution meets the minimum requirements for the week. The intent of this requirement is to promote active and open collaboration between class members.

Weekly cut-off for newsgroup contributions is each Wed @9pm EST
